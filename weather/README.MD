Sometimes response time is a very critical, and you want to reduce response time as much as you can.
The main problem in such tasks like in a distributed world you sometimes have to fetch data from another service which 
managed by another team or company. 

How to solve it ?

In this task you have three very simple stubs, it's simulate some external API which you have to use,
and the main task for you to return response as fast as possible.

Execute all requests in parallel and return data which will come first. Good luck :)
